STACKING METHOD
===============

This module comprises of all code pieces to generate input files for building a stacked classifier that classifies slot fills based on confidence values from different relation extractors.

Flow
====

DataExtractor (generate input data) -> WEKA(selecting attributes) -> WEKA (training classifier) -> WEKA (generate predictions on test data) -> Postprocessor (generate KBP format output file)

DataExtractor
=============
Extract training data for classifiers from output file of extractors and key file. Can be configured to extract slot fills by relation type or even group common and unique extractions.
 
FeatureExtractor
================

Invoked for each slotfill by DataExtractor to generate features for training the classifier. Currently some linear features and certain other basic features are extracted here.

Scorers
=======

The scorers are modified versions of official KBP scorers. They include code to track the judgement of each slot fill from relation extractor based on key file. These tracked judgements are used by DataExtractor to create training data and test data for classifier.

Classification using WEKA
=========================

The output from DataExtractor can be used in weka and converted to appropriate (.arff) format - then can be used for training a classifier model. The predictions on test data are stored and fed to postProcessor.

PostProcessor
=============
Used to create output file in KBP format for evaluation. Feed the output predictions from classifier and postProcessor throws an output file in KBP format that can be run against their provided scorer. 

NOTE: 
Currently postProcessor produces output file in 2014 format.
