STACKING METHOD 1
=================

In method 1, we attempt to build seperate classifier for different relation types.
This is challenging because the training data from 2013 queries will not be sufficient
to build models for different relation types individually.

Preprocessing before classification
===================================

DataExtractor
=============
This is the main preprocessing class that uses scorers for different years to collect the required
extractions from output files of different extractors and combine confidence values from them.


Postprocessing after classification
===================================
For each extraction presented to the classifier it indicates if it must be included in the final output.
This postprocessing class evaluates the output of the classifier and includes the classified extractions
and creates output file in the required format.
