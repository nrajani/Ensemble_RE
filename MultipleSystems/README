ENSEMBLING MULTIPLE RELATION EXTRACTION SYSTEMS
===============================================

UNION METHOD
============

UnionGenerator 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This class generates a union output from output files of 
different relation extraction systems. The output files 
from SF Validation task do not contain NIL slot fills.

Args: <path_to_SF_output_files> <number_of_systems>


SFOutputPreprocessor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This class preprocesses outputs of SF systems (taken from 
SF Validation) task and produces new output files with NIL
entries added. It runs the scorer on new output files to get
the correct performance scores for these system runs. It 
produces a summary file with P/R/F1 scores to help selecting
good systems for ensembling.

Args: <inputFilesDirectory> <outputFilesDirectory> <summray_file> <key_file>

Sample args for:
================
1)UnionGenerator - "/home/vidhoonv/workspace/RE_ensemble/system_outputs/2014" 10
2)SFOutputPreprocessor - "/home/vidhoonv/workspace/RE_ensemble/system_outputs/2014/" "/home/vidhoonv/workspace/RE_ensemble/system_outputs/2014_processed/"  "/home/vidhoonv/workspace/RE_ensemble/system_outputs/summary.txt" "/home/vidhoonv/workspace/RE_ensemble/keys/key_file_2014"
